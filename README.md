# GLAB-370.1.4-Looping-and-Decision-Making


## Welcome to the "Looping and Decision Making" Guided Lab! ðŸš€

In this 30-minute guided lab, we'll embark on an exciting coding adventure that combines the power of **loops** and **if statements** in Python. Get ready to dive into the world of repetition and decision making!

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of Python syntax.
- A Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Introduction

Let's begin by understanding the power of combining loops and if statements in Python. This combination allows us to create dynamic and interactive programs that can make decisions at each iteration!

### Step 2: The Versatile "for" Loop

In Python, the **for loop** is a versatile tool that allows us to iterate over a sequence of elements and execute a block of code for each item. It sets the stage for our coding adventure!

The general structure of a for loop in Python is:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item
```

Let's explore the possibilities!

```python
# Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Step 3: Conditional Execution with "if" Statements

Now, let's refresh our memory on **if statements**. An if statement allows us to execute a block of code only if a specific condition is met. It adds an element of decision making to our adventure!

```python
# Example:
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote!")
```

### Step 4: Combining Loops and "if" Statements

The real fun begins when we combine loops and if statements! We can use if statements inside loops to make decisions at each iteration, creating dynamic and interactive programs.

```python
# Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num, "is even")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd")
```

### Step 5: Challenge

Now it's time for an exciting challenge! Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. Using a loop and if statements, determine if the number is prime or not. Print an appropriate message accordingly.

### Step 6: Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the "Looping and Decision Making" guided lab! You've learned how to combine the power of loops and if statements to create dynamic and interactive programs.

Remember to keep practicing and exploring new concepts. Loops and if statements are essential tools in your coding toolbox, opening endless possibilities!
